# side (Shell Integrated Development Environment)

This is a project to document configuration and usage of shell as an IDE. The current set of tools that I use is fish + vim + tmux (neovim if it is installed).

1. First in stall [fish](https://fishshell.com/) + [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/).
1. Second vim is installed by default on most dev machines but [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) is works great and is very fast.
1. Checkout side: git clone git@github.com:lateefj/side.git
1. Link fish config and vimrc
